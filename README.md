As part of my Web Development Internship at OutriX, this project represents the completion of Task 1 â€” building a Weather Forecast Web Application.

The main objective of this task was to create a responsive web application that provides users with real-time weather information and a 5-day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application supports city-based search (with optional country codes) and displays weather details in a user-friendly and visually appealing format.

This task helped me strengthen my frontend development skills including:
- Working with REST APIs using JavaScript (Fetch API)
- Parsing JSON data and dynamically updating the DOM
- Designing responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS
- Implementing loading states, animations, and error handling
- Hosting the app using GitHub Pages and documenting the project professionally

The overall experience was moderately challenging and highly educational, as I practiced both UI/UX design and functional logic development within a real-world use case.

This task was completed and submitted within the internship timeline, along with a demo video and GitHub repository showcasing the live project.
